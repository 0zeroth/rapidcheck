- Maybe shrink reals to smaller values as well?
- Non-determinisim in generation might cause bad casts, report this
- Better strategy for when to give up generating
- Better size calculation
- Move test utils implementations to source file
- Generator for unique collections
- more consistent terminology, rename numTests to numCases?
- add number of discarded tests to success data
- really need some way to generate values in a range but dependent on size
- better error message if precondition not met?
- generators for std::stack? We didn't have showType for it
- const-pointers in Any?
- how to test seed in CheckTests
- support double and float in as many functions as possible
- 100 tests won't generate max :(
- std::bitset
- does std::vector<bool> even work?
- gen::greaterThan and gen::lessThan
- generators for nonEmpty collection
- compact printing of commands (repeated commands show as multiples)
- more tests for Show
- tests for Assertions
- Nothing for Seq
- replace typedef with using
- CLANGFORMAT
- TEST EXCEPTIONS AS INTEGRATION, DISCARDING ETC
- support arbitrary split/next sequences for Random? should be possible with different encoding
