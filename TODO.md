- Maybe shrink reals to smaller values as well?
- Non-determinisim in generation might cause bad casts, report this
- Exception handling
- Better strategy for when to give up generating
- Use different seeds when generating
- Generate element from a collection
- Shrink nonZero, negative, positive and nonNegative
- Adjustable test parameters... flags?
- Better size calculation
- suchThat, map, and other generators should have shrink()
- Static tests for traits
- Shrinker implementation classes to detail namespace
- Move test utils implementations to source file
- All generation params into single struct?
- noShrink, resize et al. are a bit cumbersome sometimes
- Default RandomEngine
- Better syntax for generation of commands
- Generator for unique collections
- Tests for arbitrary collections
- Should noShrink for collections be the default?
- Tests for CollectionBuilder
- Test discarding behavior
- Accepted generator bug? Shouldn't be set unconditionally?
- Assumptions about mutability in copied values... dangerous? For example, shared pointers are copied...
- Make pick() a member function
- Make default show() not depending on operator<<
- showing() method and support class for nicer integration with operator<<
- type checking in Any
