- Maybe shrink reals to smaller values as well?
- Non-determinisim in generation might cause bad casts, report this
- Exception handling
- Better strategy for when to give up generating
- Use different seeds when generating
- Generate element from a collection
- Shrink nonZero, negative, positive and nonNegative
- Adjustable test parameters... flags?
- Better size calculation
- suchThat, map, and other generators should have shrink()
- Static tests for traits
- Shrinker implementation classes to detail namespace
- Move test utils implementations to source file
- All generation params into single struct?
- noShrink, resize et al. are a bit cumbersome sometimes
- Default RandomEngine
- Better syntax for generation of commands
- Generator for unique collections
- Tests for arbitrary collections
- Should noShrink for collections be the default? Probably not, right?
- Tests for CollectionBuilder
- Test discarding behavior
- Make pick() a member function
- Make default show() not depending on operator<<
- showing() method and support class for nicer integration with operator<<
- type checking in Any
- assert strategy
- move as much as possible from include to src, Rose and RoseNode should be possible to move there
- break apart TEST_CASES?
- more consistent terminology, rename numTests to numCases?
- injective gen::map
- shrink gen::ranged
- add number of discarded tests to success data
- make pick() use a hook instead of calling RoseNode directly
- pick unique values in some nice way
- maybe some default predicates would be nice
- replace some raw loops
- static_asserts that something is a generator
- test that types like shared_ptr<T> are never stored if they don't shrink, they need to be regenerated always (IMPORTANT)
- split Generator, Shrink and Arbitrary files into smaller files
- really need some way to generated values in a range but dependent on size
- static_assert for missing Arbitrary instance
- prefer ostream<< for RapidCheck types where there's no point in having a difference between show() and ostream<<
- better error message if precondition not met
- terminology in result classes should be better, confusing now
- retry with different seed... or just ignore test?
- showtype for commands
- look at where boost places templates that need to be specialized by the user
- do we have generators for std::stack? We didn't have showType for it
- really inline defaultValue for implicit params?
- const-pointers in Any?
- how to test seed in CheckTests
- support double and float in as many functions as possible
- 100 tests won't generate max :(
- replacement for ValueDescription constructor so we don't do the same everywhere
- NOEXCEPT
- std::bitset
- does std::vector<bool> even work?
- we don't need gen::labmbda, do we?
- test gen::scale
- shrink::constant has weird behavior
- gen::greaterThan and gen::lessThan
- shrink::filter for gen::suchThat
- rename and move stuff in rc::shrink to be more generic, not related to shrinking
- generators for nonEmpty collection
- move some gen:: and similar stuff to detail namespace
- compact printing of commands (repeated commands show as multiples)
- lots of using namespace in tests... dunno if that's good
- copyable Seq + splittable random -> copyable Rose -> shrinkable implicits -> profit?
- more tests for Show
- tests for Assertions
- tests for CollectionBuilder
- type list macros should be divided differently for containers
- exceptions in copying/moving of values, generating non-property values et.c. in RoseNode may make stuff fail! In general, interactions between RoseNode and exceptions is not well understood :( Wrap the exception in Any, of course! Exceptions are values too. However, throwing during copying of copyable values should probably be InternalError or something.
- should gen::ranged really be shrinkable?
- improve Variant with noexcept, enable_if for copy constructor et.c.
